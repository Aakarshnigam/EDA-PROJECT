# Orange Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a prominent multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset offers cleaned customer activity data (features) paired with a churn label indicating whether a customer has canceled their subscription. The objective of this analysis is to delve into the data, identify key factors contributing to customer churn, and propose recommendations to enhance customer retention.

## Business Objectives

1. *Identifying Key Causes of Customer Churn*: Explore the dataset to uncover underlying factors driving customer churn.

2. *Providing Retention Strategies*: Propose actionable steps to retain valuable customers and mitigate churn.

## Guidelines

- *Code Structure*: Ensure well-structured, formatted, and commented code for clarity and reproducibility.
  
- *Exception Handling*: Implement robust exception handling for production-grade code.

- *Deployment Readiness*: Aim for deployment-ready code where the entire .ipynb notebook can be executed without errors.

- *Commentary*: Provide detailed comments explaining each logic and decision made during the analysis.

## Analysis Approach

1. *Data Exploration*: Dive into the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and distribution.

2. *Feature Analysis*: Analyze individual features to identify patterns and correlations with churn.

3. *Visualization*: Utilize charts and visualizations to illustrate insights and trends effectively.

4. *Churn Prediction*: Employ machine learning techniques to predict customer churn and assess model performance.

5. *Recommendation Formulation*: Based on insights gained, propose strategies to enhance customer retention.

## Expected Deliverables

- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Comprehensive analysis exploring various facets of the dataset.
  
- *Machine Learning Model*: A churn prediction model to forecast customer attrition.
  
- *Recommendation Report*: Detailed recommendations and strategies to improve customer retention.

## Additional Credits

Exceptional students who deliver production-grade, deployment-ready code with thorough documentation and insightful analysis will be awarded additional credits. These credits provide advantages during Star Student selection.
